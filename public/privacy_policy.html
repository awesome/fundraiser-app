<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Crowd Interactive we have a few fundamental principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
<li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</p>

<p>It is Rich Applications Consulting LLC dba Crowd Interactive ("Crowd Interactive") policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>

<p>Like most website operators, Crowd Interactive collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Crowd Interactive's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Crowd Interactive's visitors use its website. From time to time, Crowd Interactive may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>Crowd Interactive also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Crowd Interactive only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>Certain visitors to Crowd Interactive's websites choose to interact with Crowd Interactive in ways that require Crowd Interactive to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Crowd Interactive gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Retrospectus.com to provide an email address.</p>

<p>Those who engage in transactions with Crowd Interactive- by purchasing access to the Retrospectus  service, for example - are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Crowd Interactive collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Crowd Interactive.</p>

<p>Crowd Interactive does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

<p>Crowd Interactive may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Crowd Interactive may monitor the most popular features on the Clutch website. Crowd Interactive may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Crowd Interactive does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>Crowd Interactive discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Crowd Interactive's behalf or to provide services available at Crowd Interactive's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</p>

<p>Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Crowd Interactive's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>

<p>Crowd Interactive will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Crowd Interactive discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Crowd Interactive believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Crowd Interactive , third parties or the public at large.</p>

<p>If you are a registered user of an Crowd Interactive website and have supplied your email address, Crowd Interactive may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Crowd Interactive and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.</p>

<p>If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</p>

<p>Crowd Interactive takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Crowd Interactive uses cookies to help Crowd Interactive identify and track visitors, their usage of Crowd Interactive website, and their website access preferences. Crowd Interactive visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Crowd Interactive's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Crowd Interactive's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2>Business Transfers</h2>

<p>If Crowd Interactive , or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Crowd Interactive goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Crowd Interactive may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Crowd Interactive may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Crowd Interactive's sole discretion. Crowd Interactive encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
